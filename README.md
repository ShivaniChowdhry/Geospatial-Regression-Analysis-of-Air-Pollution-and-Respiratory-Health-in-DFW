# Geospatial-Regression-Analysis-of-Air-Pollution-and-Respiratory-Health-in-DFW
Project Overview: This research project utilized spatial analysis techniques to investigate the impact of air pollution on respiratory illnesses within the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Through a rigorous analysis of demographic, health, and environmental data, the study identified critical areas where elevated PM2.5 levels correlate strongly with increased prevalence of respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD.

**Objectives:**

* To map the spatial distribution of PM2.5 across Dallas-Fort Worth.
* To analyze the correlation between high PM2.5 levels and the prevalence of respiratory illnesses.
* To identify specific neighborhoods at greater risk due to combined factors of air pollution and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.

**Methodology:** Data from various sources, including the EPA, CDC, and NHGIS, were integrated to conduct the analysis. Techniques used included:

1. Generalized Linear Regression (GLR) to establish baseline relationships.
2. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to explore local variations and the impact of PM2.5 on health outcomes.

**Key Findings:**

1. Significant spatial variation in PM2.5 levels was found across the region, with higher concentrations in densely populated urban areas.
2. GWR results highlighted specific neighborhoods where the impact of PM2.5 on respiratory health was most pronounced.
3. Socioeconomic factors and land use also played significant roles in influencing health outcomes.

**Visualizations:** Several maps and graphical representations were created to illustrate the distribution of PM2.5 levels and their health impacts. These visual tools help in understanding the geographic patterns and guiding targeted public health interventions.

**Conclusion**: The findings underscore the necessity for tailored public health strategies to address air quality issues in specific high-risk areas of Dallas-Fort Worth. This study provides a model that can be adapted for similar analyses in other regions, offering valuable insights for environmental health research.
